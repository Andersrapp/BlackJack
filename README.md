# BlackJack

This is a beginners project in Java SE8. 
It was the first project I did for school in java development.
The course contained all the aspects of basics in javaSE that you could think of.
It's a very basic console game of Black Jack.
I got top grade(VG) for it and nothing has been added, removed or changed since then.

Strengths: 
- Well limited
- Validated data

Possible improvements:
- Improve modularisation
- More functions such as double and split
- Lacking GUI

Enjoy!
